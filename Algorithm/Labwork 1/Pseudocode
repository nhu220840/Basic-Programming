Process:
BEGIN
    Get a, b, c 
    Set max <- a

        max = b
    if c > max:
        max = c
    Display max, it is a largest number 
END

Ex2:
Input: Read a positive integer n
Output: Product of all positive integer <= n
Process:
BEGIN
    Get n 
    Set product <- 1
    i <- 1

        i = i + 1
    endwhile
    Display product
END

Ex3:
Input: Read 2 number a, b
Output: Display all odd numbers between a and b
Process:

            print i
    endfor
END

Ex4: 
Input: Read a positive integer n
Output: n is a prime number or not?
